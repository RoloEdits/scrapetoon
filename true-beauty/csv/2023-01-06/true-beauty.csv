She is also sincere in everything she does and with just about everyone no matter what they look like. If they treat her nicely she treats them nicely and doesn’t talk behind their backs.

I would have loved to see her embrace her monolids, get a better skincare routine and get rid of the circle lenses. I thought she was heading towards that.",2022-09-28,1458,16,17,2023-01-06

Like I love TB but this almost felt so abrupt :( like It feels out of Suho’s character to not have said a cute thing or two before asking him to marry her. I’m thankful for the time put into this webtoon and I look forward to the side stories :) ,2022-09-14,617,5,4,2023-01-06

This was the first webtoon I ever fast-passed for. I’ll miss it, but I’ll miss the fun and solidarity in the comments even more! Y’all were awesome with the rooting for Jugyeong, the ship wars, the advice in self-esteem, and more. Hope everyone sticks around for the side stories, because I sure will! 💕",2022-09-13,328,4,3,2023-01-06

Suho always seems to put her wants and wishes above his own. I wonder if she realizes that the person who helped her through  the  haunted house went she was younger was Suho. lol  you know I  am glad he proposed at home and her normal self. if he had done it during the day she would have been thinking about other things that the actual proposal.  at home he has her full sort attention.,2022-09-14,312,3,4,2023-01-06

I stopped reading for years and just came back for the final and I'm happy that I missed NOTHING and NOTHING basically changed as it progressed the way all of us knew it will at the start 😅 Thank you for the hard work tho. the art style was the selling point here and kept a lot of readers for sure.,2022-11-08,311,10,13,2023-01-06
