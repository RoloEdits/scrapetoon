I binge read the WEBTOON couple of weeks back and when he asked for another UnOrdinary from his dad, I knew that reading the book would keep his ass calm. Someone said that ""his powers are evil"" and that's why he hides it, but I don't think that's the case here. His powers are probably waaaaaay over the limit of your regular high class. Which is why his father dedicated the book to him. To show that no matter how strong you are, weaker people are not useless or below you.  ",2017-04-05,645,3,6,2023-01-06

A person's ability level is based of potential and mastery. John can copy other's abilities but we don't know limitations on that just yet so as far as we know he could copy a person's level that was 10 or something. On top of that mastery is high as well at least adding a point since he can merge abilities together being a GREAT mastery of his power so potential + mastery = 11+ability,2018-03-28,378,12,31,2023-01-06

But now, he can hold (from what we have seen) 4 elite/high tier abilities, like Claire said, the stronger the ability the harder it is to copy. Which means he can hold at least 6 mid tier abilities if one high tier =2 mid tiers. So if three amped mid tier abilities make him a 7.0, 4 elite/high tier abilities should make him AT LEAST .1 stronger than Sera. Read comment 28 for more",2020-11-25,1116,9,40,2023-01-06
