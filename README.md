# Engagement Stats

I scraped through both Webtoon and Naver to get the data. For the time being I dont plan on hosting any of the scraping here, as its slopy at best, and would rewrite it in another langauge before deciding to host it here.

Just to keep this as structured as possible, before I really figure out plans for this repo, the csvs will be in their own folder and then in subfolders named with the date of scraping. 

The format will be: Year-Month-Day
