Headon haters populations rocketed.  Strange being, Headon is.  It is hard to know what is in it's mind. [I am using 'it' for Headon because SIU have not made clear if Guardians have gender at all.]  Sometimes it is like angel, sometimes devil.  That is why I like this character so much.  Next chapter will be end of floor 1, with about 90 cuts, and floor 2 will begin the chapter after that.  Something new will be added, hope you don't miss it.^^",2016-06-12,869,2,5,2023-01-06,1,3
