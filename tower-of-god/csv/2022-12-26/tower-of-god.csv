Tower of God is one of those manhwas that have a very  low occurrence of pattern repitition. On every floor a  new background, a new game, and a new story are introduced,  and human relationships (teams) change fluidly.  Although these chapters slow down the plot progression,  I think they're necessary in Tower of God's case.","Jun 14, 2016",1125,0,12,2022-12-26

I think the power boost came from the mysterious red flame given to Kuhn two chapters ago to help bam. It wouldn’t make any sense otherwise. The sword didn’t pierce them. Notice the flame was on khun, rak, and bam. Even khun said he wasn’t entirely sure what it did. So maybe bam was the only one who absorbed whites power while the flame boosted rak and khun so they wouldn’t easily get killed fighting in the war.","Nov 07, 2021",179,10,14,2022-12-26

I think our favourite characters will now try to prevent it though. Will they use trickery of Khun A.A. to do so or make use of Bams powers for a preemptive strike? All we can do is hope SIU gets better soon so we can continue reading this masterpiece. ","Jul 31, 2022",574,5,2,2022-12-26

There’s ups and down but no one else can tell such an amazing story as yourself and there is nothing I would change on this epic story you have created. Thank you and I wish you the best of health. I hope you come back soon and remember people will always find flaws no matter what. You have created something great and people will always hate.","Jul 31, 2022",221,3,3,2022-12-26
