Remember how that whole thing with their dead friend was the source of their original conflict in high school? They started to get along better at some point but now their entire relationship is being jealous of each other over a girl. There's not as much substance there as before. I kinda hope they can be friends by the end of all this, they've been through a lot together.","Sep 22, 2020",738,3,2022-12-28,6

The reason it seems so is when one of them has romantic feelings and needs time to move past it before being in the right mindset for a platonic friendship, like Seojun. Forcing friendship here is a bad idea, esp. immediately. However, it’s possible to stay friends if there was already an existing friendship and both parties are mature, like Suho & unlike the entitled prick Haneul.

194,3628,155309,2022-04-12,Roselin Trinidad Marmolejos,I know that the whole love yourself movement is important. It certainly is for me and I know we have been rooting for jugyeong to love herself without the make up. But I can see how much more important it is to live your life however you wish to live it. If wearing make up makes people present instead of focusing on their insecurities then I say go for it. We can worry about using it as crutch another time. Letting people live a normal life is alway better no matter what. ,"Feb 15, 2022",1538,4,2022-12-28,21
