So far Currygom used a point of the true Myths behind this story, so what if what Visnu said to Kalavinka to not search for him was because, it was another Visnu? Like after ""original"" Visnu died, his transcendental would make another Visnu in purpose of prolonging the universe. But since they weren't the ""original"" Visnu, they couldn't care less about the inhabitants of the universe.
